Under current law, mergers that substantially lessen competition are prohibited. </p> <p>Additionally, for some large mergers or mergers that concentrate markets beyond a certain threshold, the bill shifts the burden of proof to the merging parties to prove that the merger does not violate the law. </p> <p>The bill also prohibits exclusionary conduct that presents an appreciable risk of harming competition. </p> <p>The bill also establishes monetary penalties for violations, requires annual reporting for certain mergers and acquisitions, establishes within the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) the Office of the Competition Advocate, and sets forth whistleblower protections. </p> <p>The Government Accountability Office must report on (1) the success of merger remedies required by the Department of Justice or the FTC in recent consent decrees; and (2) the impact of mergers and acquisitions on wages, employment, innovation, and new business formation.</p>",

                           "summary": "The Congressional Budget Act of 1974 directs Congress to adopt a budget resolution each spring, providing an agreement between the House and Senate on a budget plan for the upcoming fiscal year (and at least four additional years). The annual budget resolution includes certain spending and revenue levels that become enforceable through points of order once both chambers have adopted the resolution.Congress does not always adopt a budget resolution, however, and this may complicate the development and consideration of budgetary legislation. Congress has, therefore, developed an alternative legislative tool, typically referred to as a “deeming resolution” because it is deemed to serve in place of an annual budget resolution for the purposes of establishing enforceable budgetary levels. On June 8, 2022, the House of Representatives adopted H.Res. 1151, a deeming resolution for FY2023. H.Res. 1151 provided a committee spending allocation (302(a) allocation) to the House Appropriations Committee ($1.603 trillion). It also directed the chair of the House Budget Committee to subsequently file a statement in the Congressional Record that includes committee spending allocations for all other committees, as well as aggregate spending and revenue levels. (Those levels were filed on June 21, 2022.) H.Res. 1151 specified that the levels filed in the Congressional Record be consistent with the “most recent baseline of the Congressional Budget Office,” meaning that the committee spending allocations (other than for the Appropriations Committee) and the aggregate spending and revenue levels have been set at the levels currently projected under current law. In addition to providing enforceable budgetary levels within the House, H.Res. 1151 grants authority to the chair of the House Budget Committee to “adjust” the budgetary levels provided under the deeming resolution in the future under specified circumstances. In addition, the resolution states that provisions designated as “emergency” shall be effectively exempt from House budgetary rules and specifies that certain accounts may receive advance appropriations for FY2024 and FY2025.",
